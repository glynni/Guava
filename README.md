# Guava
Guava is supposed to be an engine for any kind of graphics rendering. This repository is meant to teach me how to work with git repositories and get a better understanding of how things are done professionally. 

## Motivation
The repository was set up with the guidance of **The Cherno**:

* github: https://github.com/TheCherno
* YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/TheChernoProject

While being heavily influenced by his educational work (particularly "Hazel game engine" videos), I am also educating myself on the topic of computer graphics through other sources. My goal is to develop my own rendering engine and not to make this project about a game engine right away. Guava might be expanded on later to also provide game engine functionality.
